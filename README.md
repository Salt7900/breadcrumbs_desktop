*And Hansel said to Gretel, 'Let us drop these bread crumbs so that together we find our way homeâ€¦'*

**Upcoming**: This is the repo for the in browser port of the iOS app. The repo for the app can be found [here](https://github.com/Salt7900/breadcrumbs)

**Note**: This repo is for the breadCrumbs frontend. There is a [separate repo](https://github.com/dinkengraven/breadcrumbs-db) for its backend, written in Ruby.

breadCrumbs is a Dev Bootcamp Phase 3 final project by three students from the 2015 Chicago Purple Martins. It was created over a period of 8 days in November 2015.

breadCrumbs is an iOS app written in Swift with a backend server written in Ruby on Rails. In its simplest form, breadCrumbs allows a user to leave themselves a note and a photo at a specific location. When the user visits this location in the real world, they receive a notification that they have a breadCrumb to view.

One example may be a shopping reminder. I could leave myself a breadCrumb at Trader Joe's with a reminder to buy cereal, and then include a photo of my favorite cereal. The next time I walk into Trader Joe's, my phone will send me a notification that leads to my breadCrumb.

A user can also leave a breadCrumb for a friend, and this was our true goal for the app. By entering a friend's email address, you can leave a breadcrumb with a photo anywhere in the world. Once your friend arrives at that geolocation, they can open the app to view your photo and message. It's a little bit of Geocaching with a dash of Snapchat.
